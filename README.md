# Coding Practice Dump

This repository is a personal collection of coding practice solutions from **LeetCode** and **HackerRank**.  
It serves as a dump of problems I’ve worked on while sharpening my problem-solving and SQL/programming skills.

## 📂 Structure
- `leetcode/` → Solutions to LeetCode problems
- `hackerrank/` → Solutions to HackerRank challenges
- Each file is usually named after the problem ID or title.

## 📝 Notes
- Solutions may not be fully optimized — the focus here is on learning and practicing different approaches.
- Some problems might include multiple versions as I experimented with alternative methods.
- Languages used vary (SQL, Python, etc.), depending on the platform and problem.

## 🚀 Purpose
This repo is mainly for:
- Tracking my progress
- Revisiting old problems for review
- Serving as a reference for future study
